Capture cap - RCT Version to prevent players from catching powerful Cobblemon early in the game and rushing through it too quickly. It is based on the RCT level.

# How does it work?

The level cap is based on the level given by the mod of RCT. You can configure the level on this basis by yourself. For example, if I am currently level 15 and I hope to be able to catch Pokémon within the level range of 15 + 5, that is, within level 20. You can make adjustments through the configuration. By default, it is level 0, which means you can only catch Pokémon below level 15.

# Modify adjustable parameters using in-game commands.

- `/gamerule levelCap <level> `# Sets the level cap for catching Cobblemon in battles.
- `/gamerule showLevelCapMessages <true|false> `# Toggles level cap failure messages.
